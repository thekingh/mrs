TODO
==============


Potential Bugs:
Some extended arms do not show in testing. This is apparent by running
corneronetunnel test with 2 vertical blocks on step 25.


finalize must write unit swaps before modules as module graph affects unit graph
when a module connects it connects all units between the two. 





X. Update grid class to have arm orientation
2. Graph class (existing or diy?)
3. Module data structure
    a. module extends unit
    b. module 2x2s have units


Notes

G -> C

make n = root coord(0, 0)
q.push (n, coord)

while q.notEmpty
    (n, coord) = pop, add to C
    for arms of n
        add to C
    for neighbors of n
        determine coords 
        push

modules will have a matrix for connections:
    row for neighbors, holds ids of NESW modules
    row for extended  vs not extended
    row for connected vs not connected

Map<Module, {E, C}) --> neighbors
for(Module m: neighbors.keySet())
