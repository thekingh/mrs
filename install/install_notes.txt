Notes on installing files related to the MRS project.

Installing processing on mac:
Note that Kabir is running 2.2.1 on his ubuntu-top. However, these notes are
for installing processing 3.0.0 on Mac OSX 10.11.1.

Download processing app from website
add Processing to path variable: Processing.app/Contents/MacOS/Processing

Install processing-java by typing "install processing-java" in help menu of
processing app

Further notes on vim-processing integration below:

download this https://github.com/sophacles/vim-processing and put the syntax folder into ~/.vim (or the file processing.vim into your syntax folder if you already have one

add these two lines to your vimrc, the first of which sets up syntax highlighting and the second allows you to run and compile from vim:

au BufRead,BufNewFile *.pde     setf processing
:command P :! processing-java --sketch=$PWD/ --output=temp --run --force

:P from vim compiles and runs a sketch

If you want to use a different editor, you can run from the command line with the command processing-java --sketch=$PWD/ --output=temp --run --force

To to get one-keystroke save compile run of processing in vim, set it to the makeprg in the vimrc:

autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.pde set makeprg=mkdir\ -p\ ./output\ &&\ processing-java\ --sketch=\"`pwd`\"\ --output=\"`pwd`\"/output\ --run\ --force


Note that this creates the dummy directory output. I've tried with mktemp and haven't gotten it to work. Then assign the makeprg to a key:

nnoremap <Tab> :wa<bar>:make<bar><CR>


The benefit of this is that different file types can set the makeprg to whatever is appropriate, and the key is always the same (Tab, in this case).:w
